CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.  CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.  CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:      Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements     Internal - by using a &lt;style> element in the &lt;head> section     External - by using an external CSS file
